# A well-structured Python project should be organized in a way that makes it easy to read, maintain, and extend.
# Below is an example of a typical Python project structure along with explanations for each file and directory:

"""
project_name/
│
├── project_name/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── module1.py
│   ├── module2.py
│   └── ...
│
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_module1.py
│   ├── test_module2.py
│   └── ...
│
├── docs/
│   ├── conf.py
│   ├── index.rst
│   └── ...
│
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── setup.py
└── LICENSE
"""
### Explanation:

# - **project_name/**: This is the main package directory that contains the source code of your project. The name of this directory is usually the same as the project nameinit__init__.py**: This file turns the directory into a Python package.
#   - **module1.py, module2.py, ...**: Each of these files is a Python module containing variotests/- **tests/**: This directory contains unit tests for the project.
#   - **test_module1.py, test_module2.py, ...**: Each of these files contains tests for the corresponding modules in the project.

# - **docs/**: This directory contains the project’s documentation.
#   - **conf.py**: Configuration for the documentation (usually for tools like Sphinx).
#   - **index.rst**: The main documentation file where content is written.

# - **.gitignore**: This file lists the files and directories that should be ignored by Git.

# - **README.md**: This file contains an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage, and any other relevant information.

# - **requirements.txt**: This file lists the dependencies of the project, which can be installed easily.

# - **setup.py**: This file contains the configuration for installing and distributing the project (used for packaging and publishing the project).

# - **LICENSE`**: This file contains the license for the project.

# This structure can be adjusted according to the needs of the project, but it represents a typical and standard layout that is widely used.
