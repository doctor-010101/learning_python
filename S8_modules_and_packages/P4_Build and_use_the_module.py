# Sure! Here’s the explanation in English:

### 1. Built-in Modules:
# These modules are included with Python by default and don't require separate installation. Examples include math, os, sys.

### 2. External Modules:
# These modules need to be installed separately as they are not included by default with Python. They are usually installed via Python’s package manager, pip. Examples include requests, numpy, pandas.

### Installing Modules:
# To install external modules, you use the pip command. For example:

# pip install requests
# This command installs the requests module.

### Naming Modules:
# Modules in Python are typically named using lowercase letters and in snake_case format (e.g., my_module). If the module is part of a package, it can include sub-packages (e.g., my_package.my_subpackage).

### Using as to Assign an Alias to a Module:
# In Python, you can assign an alias to a module to use a shorter name when accessing its functions and properties. For example:

import numpy as np
# In this example, the numpy module is imported with the alias np, and you can use this shorter name to access the module’s features:

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
# Here, `np is equivalent to numpy`.
