# Using multithreading with network requests can significantly speed up tasks that involve waiting for responses, such as API calls.

# Detailed Explanation: When making multiple network requests, the program often waits for responses. By using threads, you can send multiple requests simultaneously, improving overall execution time.

# Example:

# import threading
# import requests

# def fetch_url(url):
#     response = requests.get(url)
#     print(f"Fetched {url} with status code {response.status_code}")
# urls = [
#     "https://www.example.com",
#     "https://www.python.org",
#     "https://www.github.com",
# ]

# threads = [threading.Thread(target=fetch_url, args=(url,)) for url in urls]

# for thread in threads:
#     thread.start()

# for thread in threads:
#     thread.join()

# print("All URLs fetched.")

# Explanation of the example: In this code, multiple threads are created to fetch URLs using the requests library. Each thread performs a GET request, allowing all requests to be processed concurrently. The program waits for all threads to finish before printing the completion message.
