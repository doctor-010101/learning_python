# Definition: 
# Python offers several ways to implement concurrency, including threads, processes, and asynchronous programming.

# Detailed Explanation:

# 1. Threads (threading module): Useful for I/O-bound tasks.


# 2. Processes (multiprocessing module): Suitable for CPU-bound tasks.


# 3. Asynchronous Programming (asyncio module): Designed for managing I/O-bound tasks efficiently without traditional threads.



# Example:

# import threading
# import multiprocessing
# import asyncio

# # Thread example
# def thread_function():
#     print("Thread running")

# # Process example
# def process_function():
#     print("Process running")

# # Asynchronous example
# async def async_function():
#     await asyncio.sleep(1)
#     print("Async function completed")

# # Using Thread
# thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function)
# thread.start()
# thread.join()

# # Using Process
# process = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_function)
# process.start()
# process.join()

# # Using Asyncio
# asyncio.run(async_function())

# Explanation of the example: This code demonstrates three methods of concurrency in Python: a thread executing a simple function, a process doing the same, and an asynchronous function using asyncio. Each method serves different concurrency needs.
