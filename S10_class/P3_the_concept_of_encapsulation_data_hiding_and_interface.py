# 1. Encapsulation

# Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or class. This means that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside, and access to it is controlled.

# Purpose: The main goal of encapsulation is to protect the integrity of the objectâ€™s state by restricting direct access to some of its components. This reduces the risk of unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data.

# Implementation in Python:

# In Python, encapsulation is typically achieved using public, protected, and private attributes.


# Example of Encapsulation

# class BankAccount:
#     def init(self, account_number, initial_balance):
#         self.__account_number = account_number  # Private attribute
#         self.__balance = initial_balance         # Private attribute

#     def deposit(self, amount):
#         if amount > 0:
#             self.__balance += amount
#             print(f"Deposited: {amount}. New balance: {self.__balance}.")
#         else:
#             print("Deposit amount must be positive.")

#     def withdraw(self, amount):
#         if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
#             self.__balance -= amount
#             print(f"Withdrew: {amount}. Remaining balance: {self.__balance}.")
#         else:
#             print("Invalid withdraw amount.")

#     def get_balance(self):
#         return self.__balance  # Accessing the private balance

# # Using the BankAccount class
# account = BankAccount("123456", 1000)
# account.deposit(500)        # Deposited: 500. New balance: 1500.
# account.withdraw(200)       # Withdrew: 200. Remaining balance: 1300.
# print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1300

# Explanation:

# The BankAccount class encapsulates the account number and balance.

# The attributes account_number and balance are private (indicated by the double underscores) and cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

# The class provides methods (deposit, withdraw, and get_balance) to interact with these attributes, ensuring that the balance cannot be manipulated directly.

# 2. Data Hiding

# Definition: Data hiding is a principle closely related to encapsulation. It involves restricting access to certain parts of an object, hiding its internal state, and requiring all interaction to be performed through well-defined methods.

# Purpose: The primary goal of data hiding is to protect the internal state of an object from unintended modifications and to ensure that an object can only be manipulated in a controlled manner.

# Example of Data Hiding

# In the previous example, the attributes account_number and balance are hidden from outside access, demonstrating data hiding. Attempting to access them directly would raise an error:

# # Attempt to access private attributes
# # print(account.balance)  # AttributeError: 'BankAccount' object has no attribute 'balance'


# ---

# 3. Interfaces

# Definition: An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. In Python, while there is no formal interface keyword like in some other programming languages (such as Java), you can achieve a similar effect using abstract base classes (ABCs) provided by the abc module.

# Purpose: Interfaces allow for polymorphism and help define a consistent API for different classes, enabling them to be used interchangeably.

# Example of an Interface

# from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# # Defining an abstract base class (interface)
# class Shape(ABC):
#     @abstractmethod
#     def area(self):
#         pass  # Abstract method

#     @abstractmethod
#     def perimeter(self):
#         pass  # Abstract method

# # Implementing the interface in a derived class
# class Rectangle(Shape):
#     def init(self, width, height):
#         self.width = width
#         self.height = height

#     def area(self):
#         return self.width * self.height
# def perimeter(self):
#         return 2 * (self.width + self.height)

# # Implementing another derived class
# class Circle(Shape):
#     def init(self, radius):
#         self.radius = radius

#     def area(self):
#         return 3.14159 * (self.radius ** 2)

#     def perimeter(self):
#         return 2 * 3.14159 * self.radius

# # Using the interface
# shapes = [Rectangle(3, 4), Circle(5)]

# for shape in shapes:
#     print(f"Area: {shape.area()}, Perimeter: {shape.perimeter()}")

# Explanation:

# The Shape class is an abstract base class that defines the interface with two abstract methods: area and perimeter.

# The Rectangle and Circle classes implement this interface by providing their own versions of the area and perimeter methods.

# This allows you to treat both Rectangle and Circle objects uniformly when calculating their area and perimeter.



# ---

# Conclusion

# Encapsulation protects the internal state of an object and organizes code into classes, allowing access through defined methods.

# Data Hiding restricts direct access to object attributes, ensuring they are manipulated only through methods.

# Interfaces define a contract for classes, enabling polymorphism and allowing different classes to be used interchangeably.


# These principles are essential for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient object-oriented code in Python.
