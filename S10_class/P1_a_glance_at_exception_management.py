In Python, an "exception" refers to unexpected conditions that occur during the execution of a program, which can cause the program to stop. Exception handling allows programmers to respond appropriately to these situations and prevent unwanted errors.

▎Exception Handling

To manage exceptions in Python, the try and except statements are used. The general structure is as follows:

try:
    # Code that may raise an error
except SomeException:
    # Code that runs if an error occurs


▎Types of Exceptions

Python has various types of exceptions, such as:

• ZeroDivisionError: Raised when trying to divide a number by zero.

• ValueError: Raised when an inappropriate value is passed to a function.

• TypeError: Raised when an inappropriate data type is used.

▎Example

Below is a simple example of exception handling in Python:

def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
        return None
    except TypeError:
        print("Error: Please use numbers.")
        return None
    else:
        print("Result:", result)
        return result
    finally:
        print("Division operation completed.")

# Testing with different values
divide_numbers(10, 2)  # Output: Result: 5.0
divide_numbers(10, 0)  # Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero.
divide_numbers(10, 'a')  # Output: Error: Please use numbers.


▎Explanation of the Example

1. try: This section contains code that may raise an error. Here, we are attempting to divide two numbers.

2. except: If a ZeroDivisionError or TypeError occurs, an appropriate message is printed, and the function returns None.

3. else: If no error occurs, the result is printed.

4. finally: This section always executes, whether an error occurs or not. Here, it simply prints a message indicating that the division operation has completed.

▎Conclusion

Exception handling in Python helps you write more resilient programs and deal better with unexpected conditions. By using try, except, else, and finally, you can have greater control over your program's behavior.
