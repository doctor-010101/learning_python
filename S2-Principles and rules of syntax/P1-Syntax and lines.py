# Syntax => 👇

    # The syntax of a programming language is a set of rules and structures that determine how to write and combine programming code.
    # These rules include how variables are defined, the use of operators, the definition of functions and classes, control structures and conditional statements, loops, and so on.
    # Each programming language has its own specific syntax, based on which programming code must be written.
    
# Lines => 👇

    # 1-Physical lines =>The lines that are numbered in the editor or IDE. For example=> 👈this is the seventh (7) line
    # 2-Logical lines => The lines that the interpreter takes as lines. For example => print("hello");
    
    # Tips 👇
    
        # 1 => Sometimes a logical line consists of several physical lines and conversely.
        # 2 => To separate logical lines ";" is used.
        # 3 => "/" is used to break the line in long commands.
        # 4 =>  Comments are not separated by "/".
        # 5 => Comments cannot be written between logical lines.
        # 6 => If there are values inside ( ) or [ ], you don't need "/" to separate them and break to the next line, and you can comment after them.

# PEP 8 => 👇

    # PEP 8, sometimes spelled PEP8 or PEP-8, is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code.
    # It was written in 2001 by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Alyssa Coghlan.
    # The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.
