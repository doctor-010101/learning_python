# A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based format for data exchange that is widely used in web programming and other programming languages. JSON uses a structure based on objects and arrays, similar to how objects are defined in JavaScript.

# Key features of JSON:

# Human-readable: It is easily readable by humans.

# Widely compatible: It is supported by almost all programming languages.

# Simple structure: It consists of two main data types:

# 1. Object: A collection of key-value pairs enclosed in {}.


# 2. Array: A list of values enclosed in [].




# Hereâ€™s a simple example of a JSON file:

# {
#   "name": "Hasan",
#   "age": 25,
#   "isStudent": true,
#   "courses": ["Math", "Physics", "Chemistry"],
#   "address": {
#     "city": "Tabriz",
#     "postalCode": "12345"
#   }
# }

# In this example:

# name: is the key and "Hasan" is the value.

# age: is an integer.

# isStudent: is a boolean value (true or false).

# courses: is an array of strings.

# address: is a nested object containing other keys like "city" and "postalCode."


# JSON files are useful for data exchange between web services or for storing configuration information and simple data.
