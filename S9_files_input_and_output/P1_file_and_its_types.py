# In Python, a file is an object that allows you to store data permanently on disk and read from it. Files can be either text or binary, and Python provides powerful tools for managing them.

# Types of Files:

# 1. Text File: Text files store data in plain text format, where characters are stored as UTF-8 or other encodings.

# Example: Files with extensions like .txt, .csv, .log, etc.

# In Python, to open a text file, you specify the mode as "r" (read) or "w" (write).



# 2. Binary File: Binary files store data in raw byte format and are usually used for more complex data like images, videos, or executable files.

# Example: Files with extensions like .jpg, .png, .exe, .dat.

# To open a binary file, you use modes like "rb" (read binary) or "wb" (write binary).
