# Definition: 
# The math module in Python provides access to mathematical functions defined by the C standard. This includes functions for basic operations, trigonometry, logarithms, and more.

# Detailed Explanation: The math module is part of the Python Standard Library and provides a variety of mathematical functions that are essential for performing complex calculations efficiently. To use the math module, you need to import it at the beginning of your script.

# Useful Methods:

# 1. math.sqrt(x): Returns the square root of x.


# 2. math.factorial(x): Returns the factorial of x, an integer.


# 3. math.pow(x, y): Returns x raised to the power of y.


# 4. math.sin(x), math.cos(x), math.tan(x): Trigonometric functions.



# Example:

# import math

# # Square root
# number = 16
# sqrt_value = math.sqrt(number)
# print(f"The square root of {number} is {sqrt_value}")

# # Factorial
# factorial_value = math.factorial(5)
# print(f"The factorial of 5 is {factorial_value}")

# # Power
# power_value = math.pow(2, 3)
# print(f"2 raised to the power of 3 is {power_value}")

# # Trigonometric functions
# angle = math.radians(30)  # Convert degrees to radians
# sin_value = math.sin(angle)
# print(f"The sine of 30 degrees is {sin_value}")

# Explanation of the example: This script demonstrates the use of various functions from the math module, such as calculating the square root, factorial, power, and sine of an angle. Note that angles in trigonometric
