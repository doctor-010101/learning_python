# Definition: 
# In Python, the pipe operator (|) is used to perform union operations on sets and can also be utilized with dictionaries in Python 3.9 and later.

# Detailed Explanation: The union of two or more sets returns a new set that contains all unique elements from the input sets. When used with dictionaries, the pipe operator merges the dictionaries, combining their key-value pairs. If there are duplicate keys, the value from the rightmost dictionary is used.

# Example:

# # Union of sets
# set1 = {1, 2, 3}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# union_set = set1 | set2
# print(f"The union of {set1} and {set2} is {union_set}")

# # Merging dictionaries
# dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
# dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
# merged_dict = dict1 | dict2
# print(f"The merged dictionary is {merged_dict}")

# Explanation of the example: In the first part, the union of set1 and set2 is computed using the | operator, resulting in a new set with all unique elements. In the second part, two dictionaries are merged, with the value for key 'b' coming from dict2 because it appears last.
