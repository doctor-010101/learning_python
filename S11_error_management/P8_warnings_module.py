# Definition: 
# The warnings module provides a way to issue warning messages to developers. Unlike exceptions, warnings do not stop program execution and are intended to notify developers of conditions that might cause issues.

# Detailed Explanation: Using the warnings module is useful for indicating deprecated features, potential issues, or parts of the code that might change in future versions. It helps maintain backward compatibility while notifying users to update their code.

# Example:

# import warnings

# def deprecated_function():
#     warnings.warn("This function is deprecated!", DeprecationWarning)

# deprecated_function()

# Explanation of the example: In this code, deprecated_function uses the warn method from the warnings module to issue a deprecation warning. When this function is called, it alerts the user without terminating the program, allowing for a more graceful handling of legacy code.
